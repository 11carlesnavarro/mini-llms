# mini-GPT

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that focus on deep learning architectures, especially the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. The content is inspired and follows prominent educational video series by Andrej Karpathy.

Content
Data
Located in the data directory, you'll find input data used to train the models:

input.txt: Contains Shakespearean text.
names.txt: A dataset of English names.
GPT Karpathy
Within the gpt_karpathy directory, you'll find a from-scratch implementation of the GPT architecture. This is closely aligned with Andrej Karpathy's educational video titled "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out". The core files here are:

bigram.py: (Include a brief description here, if needed.)
gpt.py: Contains the main GPT implementation.
Notebooks
The notebooks directory is a collection of Jupyter notebooks. These are primarily based on the "Make More Neural Networks!" series, available here:

GPT_dev.ipynb: GPT development and experimentation notebook.
build_makemore_mlp.ipynb: Follows the "Make More Neural Networks!" series.
... (Continue with brief descriptions for each notebook if needed.)
